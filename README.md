# DjangoReact
This is a project with Django and React. I am having issues with it but I will post my progress as I go along.

Currently my problem that I am having trouble linking my main.css file to my page through MasterPage.html.  I do not know why this is giving me this problem.  I need to used Django template engine to link to my css.
